\usage{
simPathAR1Snp(
  nGenes = 10,
  nGenes1 = 5,
  nSNPs = NULL,
  ncSNPs = NULL,
  nSNPlim = c(1, 20),
  nSNP0 = 1:3,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{nGenes}{The number of total genes.}

\item{nGenes1}{The number of causal genes.}

\item{nSNPs}{A vector, length matched with total number of genes. Each elements of vector indicate the number of SNPs in the gene. Default is nSNPs = NULL, in this case the number of nSNPs randomly selected from nSNPlow to nSNPup.}

\item{ncSNPs}{A vector, length matched with total number of genes. Each elements of vector indicate the number of causal SNPs in the gene. Default is ncSNPs = NULL, in this case the number of ncSNPs are randomly selected from nSNP0.}

\item{nSNPlim}{If nSNPs = NULL, the number of SNPs in Gene randomly selected from Unif(nSNPlim[1], nSNPlim[2]).}

\item{nSNP0}{If ncSNPs = NULL, the number of causal SNPs in Gene randomly selected from nSNP0. Default is 1:3.}

\item{LOR}{Association in log OR between a causal SNP and outcome.}

\item{n}{# of cases (= # of controls).}

\item{MAFlim}{MAF's of the SNPs are drawn from Unif(MAFlim[1], MAFlim[2]).}

\item{rholim}{the SNPs in eahc gene are from a latent Normal
variable with a AR(rho) corr structure, rho's are drawn
from Unif(rholim[1], rholim[2]); the SNPs in diff genes are independant.}

\item{p0}{background disease prevalence;i.e. intercept=log(p0/(1-p0)).}

\item{noncausal}{exclude causal SNPs if TRUE, it is the simulation set up d in the paper(Pan et al 2015).}
}
\value{
a list of the binary outcome Y (=0 or 1) and SNPs (=0, 1 or 2);
              Y is a vector of length 2n; X is a matrix of 2n by nSNP.
}
\description{
It gives a simulated SNPs consisting of multiple genes in a pathway. Each SNPs from a latent multivariate Gaussian variable with an AR1 correlation structure.
